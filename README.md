## THIS IS NOT OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE

At the moment, this is *not* open source software. It's source code is freely viewable on GitHub, obviously,
you're presumably reading it there, but as of right now I haven't decided if I want to actually open-source it,
nor if so under what license. I choose to leave the source viewable for a variety of reasons, but I do *not*
grant permission to do anything with it other than look at it.
